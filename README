a. The dataset or a canonical reference to it (i.e., if the dataset is too large)  
  See netflix1.csv

b. Software that generates a multidimensional data visualization following guidance provided in the class  
  See main.py. 
  Required Libraries: pandas 2.2.3, plotly 5.24.1

c. Your description in one to two paragraphs of the choices you made, and why you selected the particular type of visualization that you did.  
  For this assignment, I used Python for its ease-of-use and abundant data processing / visualization libraries. In terms of data processing,  
  I used pandas for a significant portion of the data filtering. I also used Plotly which is an easy-to-use framework  
  that can create visualizations in Python.

  I created a couple types of visualizations. This data provides many different categories of data, 10 different categories, so I wanted  
  to see a few different trends. I focused my visualizations around the idea of seeing how "Western-based" the content on Netflix is.  
  I used a bubble map overlayed on a map of the world to visualize content amounts per country. For something more exact, I created a 
  bar graph to list the top 10 countries by amount of content. The content on Netflix is heavily US-based which isn't surprising, but  
  an interesting point is that India is a strong contender on Netflix. They hold 2nd place for total amount of content.
